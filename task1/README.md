# DEPI Task 1 – Linux Basics

This is my first task for the DEPI program.  
In this task, I practiced basic Linux commands and user operations through a shell script.

## 🔧 What I Did

- Created and deleted users.
- Navigated directories and managed files.
- Changed file permissions using `chmod`.
- Searched within files using `grep`.
- Used command history, date, and text editing tools like `nano`.
- Created aliases and removed them.
- Practiced file and folder operations (create, copy, move, rename, delete).

## 📁 Script

All commands are organized in a single script file:  
`user_task.sh`

Run it using:
```bash
chmod +x user_task.sh
./user_task.sh
